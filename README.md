# EasyIP
Starts a packet capture on the specified interface listening for ARP requests.  Uses these to configure IP address and set the HOST name alias in /etc/hosts so you don't have to worry about IP addresses, you can just use the HOST alias.  Will automatically update it's own IP and the HOST alias if anything changes, as long as the capture is running.
